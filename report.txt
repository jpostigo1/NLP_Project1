Exercise 1
For predicting the binary ratings of each paragraph, we used NLTK's vader
sentiment intensity analyzer. This gives us a percentage for how negative and
positive the given text is, which we use to predict the binary rating of each
paragraph. If the sentiment ratings are more negative, we predict 0 for the
paragraph; if the sentiment ratings are more positive, we predict a rating of
1. This method has been giving us an average of 65% RMS accuracy for predicting
the binary ratings of each paragraph. We believe that the accuracy is this low
because of the many paragraphs in the corpus that are not in the same order as
their corresponding numerical ratings.
